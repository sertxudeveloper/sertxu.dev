# What technologies I know?

I mainly develop web applications with the TALL stack, witch consists of Tailwind, Alpine.js, Laravel and Livewire. This website is built with the TALL stack!

I also have experience with other technologies like GIT, Vue.js, Node.js, SQLite, MySQL, MariaDB, Docker, NGINX, Apache, among others.

I've also developed mobile applications with Ionic and desktop applications with Electron, C# and .NET.

# What software I use?

For developing web applications, I use PHPStorm as I own a license with the Laravel Idea plugin, which makes my life easier.

I also use a lot Visual Studio Code, as it is a great editor for web development and many other tasks.

For developing some desktop applications I use Visual Studio, as it has support for C# and .NET without any additional configuration.

For designing, I use Figma, as it is a great tool for creating wireframes and mockups.
I even use it for creating some logos and prints.

As a version control system, I use GIT CLI, and I host my repositories on GitHub.

My daily computer is running Windows, for my servers I use Ubuntu Server with VIM as my main editor, and for my containers, I use Alpine Linux.

I also use Docker for containerizing my applications and services.

For catching any errors, I use Sentry, as it is a great tool for tracking errors and exceptions.

For testing my web applications, I use PHPUnit and Pest.
